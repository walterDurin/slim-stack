The SLiM Stack is similar to LAMP, WAMP and MAMP, **SLiM = Scala + Lift + MongoDB**.

As all PHP programmers know, LAMP stands for Linux/Apache/MySql/PHP which is a common technology stack for PHP development and deployment.

The SLiM Stack is the combination of Scala/Lift web framework/MongoDB.

SLiM's goal is to make it easy for beginners to get started with the Liftweb framework and to see how easy it is to create a website using this combination of technology.
